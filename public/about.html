<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a second-year undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which has been further validated by my achievement of securing the 3rd position in a DSA competition held at IITM College, Janakpuri. This accomplishment not only highlights my proficiency in DSA but also my competitive spirit and dedication to the field.

  Currently, I am expanding my skill set by delving into web development. This new endeavor is providing me with a comprehensive understanding of front-end and back-end technologies, enabling me to build dynamic and interactive web applications. My ongoing commitment to learning and adapting to new technologies is a testament to my enthusiasm for continuous improvement and my drive to excel in the ever-evolving field of engineering and technology.</p>
